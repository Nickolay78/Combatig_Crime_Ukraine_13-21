## https://ioyfgl-nikolay-karchevskiy.shinyapps.io/ukraine/
### About application
The manual systematizes the annual statistical reports of the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine and the State Judicial Administration of Ukraine

The data collection was carried out by downloading the reports presented on the official Internet representations of the OGP and DSA. Links to the reports have been added to the corresponding software scripts. Running scripts allows you to get local copies of the input data

Data cleaning scripts were developed based on the analysis of the features of the structure of incoming reports. The received reports were transformed into data suitable for automated processing ('clean' data)

With the help of developed automated processing scripts, selections and generalizations for further visualizations were created from 'clean' data
